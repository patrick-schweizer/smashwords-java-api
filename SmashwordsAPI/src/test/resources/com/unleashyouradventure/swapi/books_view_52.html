            Finished reading the guide today, and I had one big issue with it, and that's the lack of Word 2010 instructions. I managed to format my document, but I had to guess and go hunting to find half the relevant things. Might be an idea to see about adding word 2010 to the guide seeing as how windows 7 computers won't support much of anything but word 07 and later.<br/>

            A mix of good and bad, mostly good. Nearly all the guide is quite well done, very clear, very helpful. <br />
The one big exception is the section on getting links within a book to each chapter. You said to simply type in Chapter and your software would pick it up automatically. WRONG. It does not do so for either of my books.<br />
So, back to square one, I tried following the other directions on getting links to chapters within my books. Because otherwise I can't get them into your premmium catalog.<br />
That part of the book could not be more different from the rest, dense, confusing, and ultimately not very helpful to me. Call me extremely frustrated, and I would bet not the only one.<br/>

            I am not a techie.  I dread learning new programs.  I get easily frustrated reading most computer instructions.  Yet I found this Guide easy to understand, simple to follow, and best of all, reliable in its results.  I already had a good understanding of "styles" in Word, but other concepts were new to me, such as how to check for and eliminate extra spacing.  If you have a relatively simple document to convert for Kindle and the other ebook formats, all you need is this guide and a couple of free hours to get the job done.<br/>

            If you're looking to publish an e-book on Smashwords or Amazon, then this guide is a must-read. I read it all the way through once, just to get my head around it, and by the time I was formatting my book 'Chasing Pavements', I saw that the process was actually a lot simpler than I thought. I couldn't be happier with the 'no-AutoVetter-issues-to-sort-e-mail' after my first upload, something I had been dreading. Thanks Mark!<br/>

            Grrr! The steps which are meant to be simple are made complicated, and the complicated steps are washed over with stupid over-simplified words making it a pain to read. Plus, it's only referencing MS Office 2007. What about MS Office 2010 users? What about Mac users who use iLife? What about me, a humble Linux user, who's using LibreOffice? Sure, they're nearly all the same, but I don't want to have to write and layout an entire book, only to find out that it won't go through.<br />
<br />
We should be allowed to publish eBook formats. They're are many eBook creators out there. What about services like Feedbooks - they don't require all this hassle. All it needs is a bit of PHP programming, and TinyMCE, and away ye go!<br/>

            A WONDERFUL GUIDE for authors and especially Indie authors, like myself, who didn't know the first thing about publishing an ebook. It helped me to publish an ebook of my Award-Winning True Crime  book "Fighting the Devil", which was already available in paperback and hard copy. <br />
The guide offers simple step-bystep instructions that are easy to understand and comply with, and Mark Coker is generous enough to offer it free to all. <br />
It is definitely required reading for any author who wants to distribute their work on a marvelous place like Smashwords- the ultimate distributor for major ebook retailers. <br />
Thanks Mark- I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate you sharing your knowledge and kindness.<br/>

            This is an excellent book. It gives you step-by-step instruction to uploading your work onto Smashwords. I never would have been able to figure it out without it. My only complaint is that, since the industry changes so rapidly, the information can become outdated. For example, I have Microsoft 2010 and the book references 2007--so there were discrepancies, but they were small, and I figured them out.<br/>

            Thank you for writing this style guide. You can publish on Smashwords.com if you follow the instructions carefully. Mark made me feel that he was here with me giving hands on assistance and now I have an ebook published on Smashwords.com. Not bad for 72 years old. Thanks again.<br />

            When I finished my first novel this year, I went looking for a literary agent. The woman I found, although not accepting new writers, had lots of good advice on getting a manuscript accepted, including a pointer to Smashwords. I am now a believer in this approach to self publishing. This book by Mr. Coker was so helpful and made getting my manuscript ready for the Smashwords "meatgrinder" a breeze. Well, actually, it made the work easy to do but showed my how much work I had to do to get it ready. I'm almost there now with the novel after first publishing a short story through the meatgrinder as a trial run, with no Autovetter errors. Every Indie author should get this book and pay careful attention to the guidelines. The best parts to me were the "nuclear method" and the hints on "taming MS Word."<br/>

            I am using Style Guide (good job) but am puzzled by Step 5 The Nuclear Method. I am using MS 7 and MS Word 2010. I have the chapters previously sent to CreateSpace on a cd. How do I transfer the cd info to MS Word 2010 with MS 7? Perhaps tweeking Step 5 for we Word 2010/MS 7 users would be helpful.<br/>

            When I first considered publishing my book via Smashwords, I felt intimidated. Could I do this? Would the resulting work look good? How hard IS it to do? <br />
<br />
This book was excellent. I read it through, then took my manuscript and worked on it, step by step. Formatting wasn't as hard as I thought it would be because the author truly put it in layperson's terms, along with illustrations. Amazing also what I learned about Word! (And I've been using Word for years.)<br/>

            I take issue with MT Lincoln. I worry about him. If he can't figure out what the author is trying to say, perhaps he should look to himself rather that criticise, what is essentially a quite well written and very useful book. Incidently smashwords does use the epub format, but I found it more useful to use PDF for adobe on my computer. I had not published an ebook before, but following instructions in the Styleguide, I successfully published four, each one at the first attempt was included in the Premium Catalogue. And incidently the system for Table of Contents is not absurd and actually works. Finally do not blame other people if you elect to use a MAC.<br/>

            This book is useless. First, it's outdated. Second, it has nothing useful for Mac users. Third, it's written as if English is the writer's second language. I've been a computer/Word/Mac & PC user for 27 years and I can't figure out what the author is trying to say. He takes what should be simple and makes it complicated. And what's more to the point, why does Smashwords not use the near-universal epub format? Why make it more difficult? The epub is a simple and flexible method--easy to do and easy to validate. This bookmarking schema for the ToC is absurd. I do conversions very day of my life, and unless my hapless clients use Smashwords, it's a pain-free operation. Feh.<br/>

            Thanks for taking away my headache. <br />
<br />
I need to publish a short story as my final project for a digital publishing course. Hours searching for the best platform to format my content left me with the migraine of the century. You see, certain individual suggested that Smashwords wasn’t the best platform for self-publishing. I trust this person, and I’m very loyal, so of course I went elsewhere first. I know what you are thinking, and you are correct, my friend, (Ugh, the horror!) <br />
<br />
I write fiction—simple text with a cover that I hope will help my tale. Fifteen minutes with the Smashwords Style Guide showed me that it would do wonders for what I need. I’m going to get a glass of wine, and give this guide the reading it deserves. <br />
<br />
Again, thanks a bunch for this free ebook. My head owes you one ;-)<br/>

I'm excited to have joined Smashwords and look forward to adding more titles with the help of what I've learned here!<br/>

            What an incredibly helpful and well-presented guide, Mark. I can't thank you enough for making this guide available for us indie authors to follow the step-by-step process of publishing on Smashwords. <br />
<br />
To those naysayers and short-cutters out there I say, NAY!! 'Tis not so!! <br />
<br />
The ONLY way to get your book to pass the all-too-important "Meatgrinder" and "EPUBcheck" (which mine did FIRST TRY) is to follow Mark's instructions to the letter. I was fortunate in that I was working with a manuscript that originally came from MS Word 2003 but, now that I am using MS Office 2010, it's a little different in the style guide's instructions...BUT...this guide also gave me the unexpected bonus of teaching me things about MS Word 2010 I never knew existed!!<br />
<br />
I am now believing that inclusion in the Premium Catalog is an almost "sure thing" and I eagerly anticipate plugging into the Smashwords community further.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br/>

            Five star review from Brittany of Guru Books: In Gold Standard of Thin, Janice Rowland and Kathleen Rowland offer "a guide for steady weight loss and rich health." The Rowlands address fitness from the inside out, providing readers with inspirational "nuggets for your inner self," curing the underlying motivations for binge eating and depression that precludes us from being active. By teaching us to "stop feeding our feelings," readers are able to break away from the cycle of depression, frustration, and disappointment that lead to eating, which in turn leads to more depression, frustration, and disappointment.<br />
<br />
The Rowlands offer delicious recipes that are as tasty as they are healthy, helping dieters to stick with their diet programs by providing them with ideas for healthy eating that will not leave them feeling deprived. Among their recipes are: Banana Peanut Butter Rolls, Cilantro-Lime Steak Fajitas, Beef Rib Roast with Shallots and Herbs, and Lobster Salad with Lemon and Basil. One of the strengths of these recipes is a true relevance to modern social situations that tempt us to "cheat" on our diets, often leading us to return to former eating habits.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you are entertaining and do not want to serve your guests diet food; Glazed Ham with Sugar Snap Peas, Carrots, and Leeks is an elegant and delicious dinner for eight. For others whose challenges include snack time, lunch at work, or eating at home alone, there are appropriate recipes for every situation, encouraging consistent and sustainable healthy eating.<br />
<br />
In the exercise portion of Gold Standard of Thin, the authors address both traditional exercise and encourage fun ways to burn calories and build strength from sailing and gardening to Nintendo Wii and horseback riding. By making fitness an enjoyable proposition, readers are motivated to get fit, have fun, and maintain their exercise programs. Through the variety of suggestions offered, dieters can never grow bored with their fitness regimes, finding ways to keep their program fresh.<br />
<br />
In a market pervaded by unhealthy fad diets that only lead to water weight loss and breaking down lean muscle, Gold Standard of Thin offers real solutions for real health from real women and for real women. Through the application of their advice, readers will find weight loss simple and manageable, demystifying the often-daunting task of dieting and exercising. Janice and Kathleen Rowland guide dieters down the path to real, healthy, and sustainable weight loss. It is through a program of solid advice, nutritious and delectable recipes, and enjoyable exercise that they teach readers that getting fit can actually be fun!<br/>

            I found this easy to understand.  And the way Mark Coker often repeats himself is a big sell for me.  I will use this often in preparation of my own books that I want to publish here at Smashwords.com.  I give it five stars.<br />
<br />
Great job Mark!<br/>

            I found the guide kind of confusing and hard to follow. As someone else here mentions, it is repetitious.  I didn't think it was written in too user-friendly a language. But I will re-read it to see if it makes sense the second time around:)<br/>

            This is well written and easy to follow. My only issue is that Coker often repeats himself. But it's so helpful I'd give it 4-1/2 stars if that were an option!<br/>

<br />
Highly recommended to all self-publishers. This e-book surely shows that Smashwords is the greatest self-publishing source!<br/>

            This guide was very easy to follow. It takes some reading but if you follow the instructions in this guide, your book really does go through the Meatgrinder without any issues whatsoever. It saved me a lot of headache, that's for sure. A MUST READ for anyone who wants to self-pub on Smashwords.<br/>

            This book helped me to publish my first e-book back in 2011. It is excellent. It touches many subjects including Microsoft Word. <br />
<br />
In addition, the variety of distribution channels at Smashwords takes out a lot of pain for the authors when it comes to getting the word out about the published book. <br />
<br />
Smashwords is a good place to start and to continue your writer's career.<br/>

I just wonder how the man has managed not to go insane in the process of gathering all of this wisdom and instead chooses to give it freely to the world....ok so maybe he didn't escape completely undamaged!

            Wow, a very detailed book! I went through all the information until I decided to opt for contacting Mark for his list of formatters in the end since I am in a bit of a rush (impatient)to get my two books formatted for Smashwords.  <br />
In the future I will, however try to follow the guide and learn this on my own if I decide to write another book! It was a very well written manual with a lot of detail that was easy to follow.<br />
Thank you for sharing Mark!<br/>

            I always wondered what the backward "P" button on word did. Now I know. This style guide is essential for anyone wishing to use the exciting medium of Smashwords to publish their work, and it is written with clarity and pragmatism. So if you think your words only overlap when you've had too many beers, think again...<br/>

            I loathe Word and I absolutely refuse to use it. The last decent version was 5.1. (I started off with version 1, BTW.) Word 6, the last version I used, or rather tried to use, still remains, for me, the worst piece of software ever to be released upon an unsuspecting and undeserving public.<br />
<br />
But that has little to do with Mark Coker's guide. As long as you find a word processing program that can export or save to Word's .doc format you will be just fine using this guide, especially if you start with what Mark calls the Nuclear Method. By copying and pasting my files into a strictly-text-only program I saved myself a lot of bother with one file that had become corrupted. I still use a separate file for each chapter because in the early days Word didn't like long documents, so one corrupted file in several hundred isn't too bad. But, as Mark points out, if your files have gone through several versions of Word or several different word processing programs (as mine have) you are bound to come across corruptions that you didn't even know about. And they WILL cause you grief if you don't follow the Nuclear Method.<br />
<br />
I have to say I wholeheartedly recommend this guide, especially for writers who haven't gone to the bother of finding out how to use their software properly (e.g., they use the tab key instead of setting up proper indents).<br />
<br />
The guide is quite lengthy and looks far more daunting than it is. It's actually very easy to follow and extremely thorough. I'm not letting my hatred of Word get in the way of giving it the five stars it deserves.<br/>

            This guide was amazing. It helped me greatly in how to format my books and even gave me tips on how to learn microsoft word better. It was written so that anyone could clearly understand how to go from guide to computer screen and make the  necessary corrections. I greatly appreciate that this resource is available! Thanks, Smashwords!<br/>

            Excellent way educate rookies on how to format and ebook. I particularly like his clear communication. You are guided step by step throughout the process, and he always predicts your potential thoughts, so you are well guided through this maze. In the end, once you have it all integrated, it isn't as tough as you once thought it was. Thanks for the Guide. A way to maximally exploit the manual is by creating a BETA of any work you have, and do the formatting process as you advance in the reading.<br/>

            I have to say I was rather disappointed.  And I don't know who to be disappointed at.  I meticulously went through hundreds of pages of my existing work to make sure all was well according to what everyone calls this "Bible of Smashwords", only to find that though it made it through MeatGrinder (autovetter), it was still lacking any true form of WYSIWYG.  The material is dated and doesn't seem to explicitly state the issues with making blank lines (a problem where I bested my own solution).  Coker tells you how not to do them, but an alternative (in the same step-by-step process) on making blank spaces.  Autovetter errors, FAQ's, Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac, global warming - not sure who to blame, but I want my day and a half of formatting (something that I was certain was properly formatted in the first place) back.<br/>

            The Style Guide is very informative but some things are not clear, especially when it comes to "text box errors". You cannot really use the Nuclear Method if your childrens picture book has images and there are no instructions in the guide to help fix this problem. After 2 queries to Support, we have not received an answer and our new ebook is being held up from the Premium Catalog because of this error. I also wish there was more info on using the newer versions of Word.<br/>

            This guide is so well-written and comprehensive, it's indispensable for anyone who wants to publish an ebook without tearing their hair out. Last year I paid someone to kindle-ize my book, then did my second myself. Thankfully, I found this book as I was getting my third ebook ready for epub. As one who tries to write how-to manuals clearly, I so appreciate the way this is written, simply but clearly, with all steps explained. The diagrams are hugely helpful too. Thank you!<br/>

            So, after failing to upload my eBook on my own, I read the Smashwords Style Guide.  Should have started out this way, it really made life easier!  One thing I would like to see added:  I had trouble finding my hidden text boxes.  The easiest way, for me, was to view my document as a web layout.  It popped right up.  Thank you again for created this book and for making it so easy to follow!<br/>

            This book is interesting, at least to anyone wanting to have her work published on Smashwords. It would be very convenient, though, to have the whole book available in a single page, so much easy to search for keywords or specific subjects. Thanks.<br/>

            Brian; For what it is worth--the meatgrinder and epubchecker do not like MS2010. Hidden code I guess. I have three books I'm trying (now for about 5 months) to get past it for preme status. They say there is a text box...after having three people look at the manuscript and four other authors review the file which I provided them on a flash drive they all comment--"What text box???....where??" I reply  --THAT is my question. Other than these skimpy details, its a decent guide.<br/>

            The guide is very Windows and Office 2007-centric. You'll have a hard time following along if you use a Macintosh and any other version of Office. Not only that, beware that the staff of Smashwords may be enforcing the content of the Style Guide a little too rabidly. I'm a professional typesetter. I managed after a great deal of experimentation to produce a very good epub which everyone says looks spectacular, and which passes epub verification with ease, but Smashwords has so far rejected it from the Premium Catalog because I use "too many font sizes" (I use four: title page, chapter headers, body text, and a smaller indented body text for quotes such as poems and newspaper articles – trust me folks, this is perfectly legitimate formatting in the real book world, and it looks great in an epub), but some Smashwords newbie fanatic employee has rejected it, probably because somewhere in the guide it says you should only use one or two font sizes. In principle, I agree that this is a good guideline for amateurs, but for pros this is a ridiculous rule. Mark Coker – you need to hire people whose skill is in aesthetics, not counting. One other thing – why the heck don't your staff respond to support queries? I've sent three over the last 10 days and received zero replies.<br/>

            So easy to use and really helpful, thank you. I started by stripping all the formatting from my doc (by pasting into wordpad and then back into a word doc) and then just working through the guide. It took me just an hour to format my book the way it needed to be!<br/>

            The Smashwords Style Guide is a must-read for new and experienced authors. Mark has done a terrific job of constantly updating the Style Guide to match authors needs.  Got a question about editing your ebook? You'll find it in the Style Guide. Can't find the answer? Then ask at the Smashwords Forum.<br/>

            This really helped with my book formatting. It makes it really easy to do! And, the only problem I ever had was with the hyperlinks - but that was because my version of word was giving me glitches! It's a really easy to use guide! I was happily impressed at how easy it was to navigate.<br/>

                                    <br/>
            When I decided to publish my cookbook into an e-book, I started with Amazon kindle.  Their instruction page telling you how to convert to mobi is so confusing and after several attempts I gave up.  I never believed I would be able to publish.  After several months I decided to try again and on Amazon forum I read a suggestion by an author to check the tutorial at Smashwords.  <br />
What can I say.  The tutorial covers everything.  However don't read through lines quickly but read it thoroughly, even more than once, if needed, in order to understand what you need to do.<br />
The only thing missing, however, is if we can publish in other languages, except English.  <br />
I would like to publish my cookbook in my native language, as well, which is Greek but I haven't yet got a reply to my question from support.<br />
Thank you Mark for all your help.<br/>

            If you take the time to read this guide, it will greatly help. It does take a little time, but if you put the time and energy into it, it will get the job done and save you some money in the process by doing it yourself. It is easy to follow and understand if you pay attention.<br/>

            An indispensable, informative guide.  As a newbie formatter whose book gained acceptance into the Smashword's Premium Catalog, I learned a lot from this book and will continue to refer to it as I publish more works on Smashwords.<br/>

            The Smashwords Style Guide is easy to read and understand. I use it often as a reference when I publish to Smashwords and have yet to find a question that the guide could not answer. Thanks for making publishing such a sweat-free experience!<br/>

            This book delivers exactly what it promises.  You follow the rules and your book gets included in the Smashwords premium catalog.  You may not like the process but it does work.  So as my 6th grade English teacher used to day.  Mr. Driscoll just follow the directions for once in your life.  You might like the results.  Thanks Mark!<br/>

            A wonderful guide which even I understood and was able to implement.  Formatting, and the time taken to learn how, is hard work, but the results are immensely satisfying.  thankyou, thankyou, thankyou.<br />

            I will say formatting my novel took a lot longer than I had hoped, but that was due mostly to the fact that I have the newest version of microsoft, which should make things simpler, but doesn't. So anyone out there with the newest version of windows 7, hunker down and be prepared to figure some things out on your own. Other than that, I found the style guide extremely helpful and found that everything uploaded properly.<br/>

            Step by step guide that takes all the mystery and missteps out of eBook formatting. I've been struggling for years trying to figure out why my books don't translate the way they should. I followed the guide step by step and now I have an eBook I can be proud of and hopefully sell.<br/>

            I am tired of seeing cheap ePubs generated by "pro" software - like poorly written iPhone apps, they undermine the whole idea. Unless you properly format the Word file the outcome will look horribly cheap and unprofessional. I am very grateful for the guide because it teaches you to properly format as you write.<br />
 <br />
To the previous reviewer: books ARE written in "stone age" Word unless you've invented a "pro" generator of content for your ePubs.<br/>

            I feel like an idiot trying to fix those formatting "errors"<br />
I use a pro software to generate epubs. So why not let us upload native epub instead of fiddle about Word which is completly stone age IT.<br />
Sorry, but this really sucks<br/>

            Well, forgive me for putting a damper on all the reviews below. <br />
I thought you just re-wrote this?<br />
But all the directions only include up to using Word in 2007? What about Vista and Windows 7?<br />
I cannot complete some of the things you have instructed us to do because the book is not up to date with present technology.<br />
Please go back and make this current. Thanks!<br/>

This is a brilliant guide, well written and easy to follow; I found the section on hyperlinks particularly useful. <br />
Invaluable for all documents and a great tool for your wonderwordage...<br/>

            When I read the word formatting I thought oh oh, how difficult is this going to be. But hey, it was not difficult at all. I did my first novel and followed the guidlines which are sharp and easy to understand. After that the rest I just formatted the same way. Mine were simple text but I am sure if I should wish to do something more elaborate that the rest of the guide would lead me through that as easily as before. Thanks Mark and team, you know how to do it!<br/>

            I appreciate that the style guide provides so much useful information, and that it is refined periodically. It has gotten a lot better in the two years since I first read it.<br />
<br />
However, I agree with what L. Frank Turovich says: "I think the guide would be much improved if the steps were more layered in organization. I know I don't want to wade through page after page looking for that one specific step I need to remember, then read through several long paragraphs for the exact info I need." His suggestions for how to layer each step are terrific.<br/>

                                    <br/>
            Updating the guide is always good, but different versions of Word have their settings in different locations. Showing where to find them in Word 2011 would be extremely helpful and cut down confusion and save many users time. <br />
<br />
Also, showing the differences for Win and Mac clients would help as well. For example, on page 21 under Step 2 - Activate Word's Show/Hide, the Show/Hide command does not appear on the ribbon or toolbar by default in the Mac version. It has to be added by the user to appear.<br />
<br />
In addition, the overlays that appear on some images could be more readable. Instead of hand scrawling the words and arrows, enter it using a readable font in any graphic's program and use an arrow tool (both supported in SnagIt, btw, a great PC program for grabbing screen images and marking them up).<br />
<br />
Finally, I think the guide would be much improved if the steps were more layered in organization. I know I don't want to wade through page after page looking for that one specific step I need to remember, then read through several long paragraphs for the exact info I need. In other words:<br />
<br />
1. Provide a step overview section that described all the steps at a high-level so experienced users can find the info they need immediately.<br />
<br />
2. Provide step-by-step instructions like you have now, but organized slightly differently. Begin with a short rule, then any settings required to satisfy that rule, then follow with a more in-depth description. For example, in the step describing images, tell the reader up front the max dimensions an image should be. Don't bury it deep in the description.<br />
<br />
3. Whenever possible, provide the user an example that illustrates the step done correctly.<br />
<br />
A great place to see how one should document software programs/processes using well known, defined style conventions and languages can be found in the Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications.<br />
<br />
The current guide has all the information a user needs to be successful, but with just a bit more organization and by layering the information to facilitate the readers level of experience, it could be so much easier to read and comprehend for everyone.<br/>

            The updated style guide is wonderful. I can assert that even a layman can format books if he is ready to read the instructions carefully and in steps, without ever trying to be over-smart,for I was in my initial adventures with the earlier guide and I had to resubmit books five or six times. But now I have been able to send more than hundred books to the premium catalog.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mark Coker and his team do care for the author, publishers, and the readers.<br />
<br />
All the best.<br/>

            Great information!  Followed instructions to the letter (we used to do things in Corel *sigh*) and our first conversion went straight thru with no errors!  Thanks for the great tutorial and tips!<br/>

            This guide is a blessing to publishers new and experienced. The first time I read this, I was so surprised that I, as technologically challenged as I am, could understand everything. It's well organized and easy to find the information I need to go back for - thank you so much!<br/>

            I like the idea of your Meatgrinder.  One issue for me is the different formatting styles required for publishing.  Editors required different formats for their reading, not always what the copy editors wanted, so about 3 different versions of my manual had to be saved.  <br />
<br />
I'd have liked this style guide when I was learning how to use Word.  I learned most of the tips you mention through trial and error.  I followed along using one of my rough drafts and found I'd have to do a lot of re-formatting even though it's an .rtf file.  Thanks to your publishing this book, I can do all my files right the first time.<br />
<br />
4 stars - there's always room for improvement.<br/>

            It cannot be overstated how helpful this book is to the novice ebook author.<br />
<br />
I followed it through for my book and had not a single auto error.  Even when I spotted a few tweaks that I needed to make, I went back to the guide and all the answers were there.<br />
<br />
With apologies to fundamentalists - this book is Biblical in its wisdom.  I followed the Word, and it was a Smashword.<br/>

            Back in the '80s, the Commodore 64 computer used the term "Patience is a virtue." It referred to obscenely long time it took to load a program into the computer's memory.<br />
<br />
The same applies to Smashwords Style Guide.<br />
<br />
Last week I wrote a not-too-kind review on the Guide. By the end of the week, after I followed it step-by-step, I felt obligated to delete that review.<br />
<br />
The Guide does work if one takes the time to follow the steps in the order outlined in it. My book, "Crossing the Rainbow Bridge ... Your Pet: When It's Time to Let Go," although not yet reviewed, delivered no errors in formatting when I READ and FOLLOWED the instructions.<br />
<br />
My apologies to Mark Coker for jumping the gun.<br/>

            The information is very helpful, but the formatting is screwy in places. Well worth a detailed read.<br/>

            Regrettably, I have given up. Page 40 is missing, one that is vital, whatever is described in the guide does not relate to what I see on the computer, and at around P41, where it says an error if you have a particular thing in a paragraph, I find it is impossible to remove. As I doubt that my book would have earned enough to cover the cost of paying somebody, my book will stay in the drawer forever.<br/>

            This guide was super helpful. By carefully following the instructions, I managed to get it through all the steps involved in publishing without too much heartache. I have no idea how I would have done it without such easy step by step instruction. And I am a very experienced computer person. The instruction is not just about the formatting, it's all the other stuff about front and back matter, ISDN, etc. Great Job!!!<br/>

            The Guide is very user friendly. At first I thought I would be bored with a dry technical kind of guide but I was pleasantly surprised at the very clear and simple explanations and illustrations. The Guide is also useful for people like me who are not familiar with all the features of MS Word and the e publishing scene.<br/>

            Great source of helpful but very practical information about the "real" business of eBook publishing and successful sales.<br />

Mark Coker deserves a huge amount of credit for an outstanding job of writing this superb style guide!<br/>

            Read it through once before you start, then again while you're formatting your book. Do this and you can't go far wrong. Well-written and very easy to follow. Good job.<br/>

            No easy feat to format a book by oneself for publishing, but not impossible either. It would have been nearly impossible for me without this guide--love the step-by-step format, the friendly approachable tone, and the visual images. Do wish each "update" used different colored letters for the new sections/sentences added (esp. since I was consulting the guide throughout a span of a few months, and had to keep rereading to ensure I hadn't missed a change). I've got a 83000-word book to get out there (The Art of War: a Novel), so the manual nitpicking was time-consuming, but I believe it'll be worth it...! Thanks Mark.<br />

            I think this guide was fantastic. I especially like that the author took the time to differentiate between the versions of Word. This enabled me to use my 2003 version (at my office) and my 2010 version (at home) with very little confusion. I helped a fellow author format his book in just under 1 hour and mine in just under 1 hour using different versions of Word. I would guesstimate that I will format my next 60-80,000 word novel in about half an hour. I also like that the guide can be skimmed through if you just need to find specific sections, thanks to the handy table of contents. Or, if you're a complete newbie, contains simple, step-by-step instructions.<br/>

            This book is only useful if you use Microsoft Word.  If you use Open Office, the instructions are meaningless and extremely difficult to follow.  I would appreciate an appendix for authors who use other word processing programs besides MS word and an executive summary that assumes a basic level of competence with html and basic document formatting (the current edition contains far too many step by step instructions for things that could be explained in much simpler terms--again, good if you're a complete beginner but very difficult to skim and use as a reference if you have even a basic level of experience).<br/>

            The guide was clear, straight forward, and easy-to-understand.  However, it was long and arduous for a creative (like myself). :-)  Having said that, we felt confident that our ebook would work in ANY format after following ALL the instructions and so far, so good.  Great job and thank you!!<br/>

            The book is methodically written and presents scenarios and situations so you will not get lost. Mark writes with the intention to help authors looking to expand their horizons. This book is the ultimate go getter - follow it to the letter.<br/>

            This book is designed to help people get the most out of their own books on smashwords and it certainly does that. If you follow the guide to the letter you will get the best distribution you could possibly manage. Of course this is a double edged bonus as everytime that you do well, smashwords do well, and if they do well every author published here benefits as Mark Coker is able to add more value to Smashwords. It will also help you boost your potential sales by giving you a more professional outlook. Follow this guide religiously its a win-win scenario.<br/>

            This is by the guy who owns this site, right?<br />
This is truly exceptional work, indeed. In fact, this guide written by Mr. Coker is essential for anyone wishing to publish their work on Smashwords. However, it would be nice if authors were allowed to upload their own epub, mobi, etc., files directly to ensure they are formatted the best way possible instead of being sent through a generic "meat-grinder" conversion as the term for this site's machine has been popularly termed across these far and wide "interwebz" in blogs, forums, and such. This rates five stars, though. In summary: Arnold Schwarzenegger + Quentin Tarantino = Oscar-Winning Box Office Megahit.<br/>

            The Smashwords Style guide is great, and of course MUST be adhered to if you don't want your ebook slicing, dicing and generally reconstituting as offal by Meatgrinder. However I have found one aspect a source of repeated frustration. I, along with many others, use Open Office (and now Libre Office) rather than MS Word. A small difference of opinion between Libre Office and Meatgrinder means that the lines in the converted .epub tend to come out on top of each other; which looks...interesting. Mark's solution (essentially: don't use Open Office) means that every time I want to upload an ebook I need to borrow someone else's laptop. As I say, a small gripe in an otherwise great experience, but surely there must be another way around this one tiny, but irritating, glitch?<br />

            I have read this book to help me meet the requirements for submission into smashword's premium catalog and it really was my salvation in meeting the requirements.<br />
Mark Coker is correct, if you will follow this guide word by word, line by line, you can pass the requirements for the catalog. I will use this guide over and over with each book that I attempt to submit, it is that important! Thanks Mark!<br/>

            Smashwords Style Guide is really smashing!! I followed it very closely and carefully to format my 'Why I am Not a Hindu' and I didn't get a single Auto Vetter error message on publishing it. Besides, it passed the EPUBCHECK in the very first attempt! So, naturally, I am celebrating and thanking Mark Coker for writing the Style Guide<br/>

            Smashwords Style Guide was most helpful in creating my first ebook. It assisted me every inch of the way with formatting, style, hints and tips on editing, and creating an ebook cover. I couldn't have done it without the sound knowledge of the author. Very well written, spaced out and just an absolute gem! Thanks.<br/>

            Mark Coker's Smashwords Style Guide was dead on. It's lucid, direct, no-nonsense, yet light enough to keep you moving forward. I followed his instructions precisely and here I am: my first e-book made it through the meatgrinder without even a snicker or a cough. I'm now on to Coker's marketing book and have every reason to believe it will be just as good.<br/>

            Great and very thorough guide. The only thing I might add is a quick blurb about dedication pages in the front matter, but otherwise very well written and easy to follow. It was great to have this while formatting.<br/>

            A very useful and interesting guide, written in an accesible form - including for those not too familiar with the mysteries of various publishing programs. Sometimes we, the writers, are too cloudy brains, but such guides are helping us to navigate through the right clouds (of the publishing industry, of course).<br/>

            Well, I knew nothing about how to format for epub. But after reading the style guide several times I also hope to publish my work some day here! And for this the sincere effort of the author Mark Coker is highly commendable and recommendable.<br/>

            This was a great style guide, which I breezed through quickly and easily. The only thing I have a suggestion for is the part that shows you how to do the Table of Contents. It's much easier than hyperlinking and all that. Simple make your Table of Contents with Word's automatic TOC builder (make sure you uncheck the page numbers and check the hyperlink button) then you highlight the entire TOC, copy it and paste it in. It'll come out hyperlinked and ready to go. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, this style guide made this an easy upload.<br/>

            Mark Coker has produced an excellent guide to preparing your eBook for publication on SmashWords. He takes you through each of the steps necessary to format the eBoook and you'll learn a lot more about MS Word in the process - I know I did.<br />
My little eBook is almost ready and views fine in all the eBook readers, thanks to this guide.<br/>

            Mark has done a great job detailing how to format your book for Smashwords. I would like to see an update for Microsoft Word 2010, especially since doc files are no longer used by Microsoft. I was tempted to use Open Office but I am glad I followed Mark's advice and purchased Microsoft Word 2010. I was able to get my book into the premium catalog on the first try.<br/>

            Thanks...even with a few errors, this ebook helped me fix errors I've never even heard of! Just one problem...I wanted a bunch of paragraphs on one page, and this told me to merge them into ugly bunches, but if you just insert continuous section breaks I get much better results! But still, a very informative, helpful ebook.<br/>

            Mark, I was simply boggled at how much more complex it is to prepare a book for digital distribution than I imagined. Your exceptional style guide made a world of difference. Thank you for taking time to do this and help other authors!<br/>

            This style guide is very informative. It helped me to better understand ebook publishing in general. It took some very concentrated time but I found the guide to be easy to understand and follow. I actually had fun formatting my book. I also learned some things about Microsoft Word that I didn't know before.<br/>

            Easy to read and simple to understand. Well written instructions that remove the "intimidation factor" of self- publishing. Helping me to become a published author of books I have written for years. Have highlighted much of it to refer back to when I am working on each book. Have read three times through and will continue to use as a reference and probably read again. I have many years experience with MSWord but less than a year with MsWord 2007 and have learned new and helpful things from this guide.<br/>

            At first I was intimidated when I glanced at the guide...but then when I really had time to work on a book and followed the guide carefully enough, it was worth it. You just have to take it in small doses. ^^ 5/5<br/>

            After reading this e-book and carefully following the easy to understand directions I was able to properly format and successfully upload my books on the very first try. Read the Smashwords Style Guide before you upload and you'll have it right when you publish.<br/>

            Nice step by step guide. <br />
<br />
I have a tip though if people out there don't want to do the "nuclear" option. In Word, save your DOC document as a RTF file, then re-open it in Word and save it back as a DOC file. By going DOC->RTF->DOC, you remove all of the unnecessary (and probably problematic) Word-added junk but still keep the basic formatting like indent, justify and bold - which you lose if you go the "nuclear" option.<br/>

            After researching and reading many online comments about the troubles of formatting, I thought I would just pay for an editor to get my ebook set for premium distribution. Instead, I decided to follow the style guide, and it is so much easier than I feared.  Less than 24 hours after starting the edit, it was submitted, and soon after approved for premium distribution and 10 samples immediately uploaded. A great, step by step guide. I will use the book and the service again.<br />

            How explicit can you get?  He tells us, step by step, exactly what to do, then shows us how it should be done.  If you're publishing ebooks anywhere, you need to read this, several times.  Download a copy and practice this...it works.  Wonderful job there.<br/>

            This is a clear, concise, and complete guide for publishing on line.  By removing the mystique of the machine, Mark makes it painless for even a non-techie to publish. I was particularly thrilled to discover how easy it is to do hyperlinks! Who knew?<br />
<br />
If you have any doubts about epublishing, read this style guide and enjoy smooth sailing.<br />

Thanks so much for your style guide. I'm new to ebook publishing and your step-by-step instructions to format an ebook is very helpful.<br />
<br />
My next move is to distribute my free ebook "Sell House Fast For Cash" via Apple iBookstore, Barnes & Noble, Sony, Kobo and Diesel, and with your help, I can achieve that. Thank you.<br />
<br />
It's good to know that SmashWords.com is out there and able to help new authors like myself...<br />
<br />
Mark, my appreciation to your site and the SmashWords program.<br />

            Creative, all-encompassing and HONEST. This book opened my eyes wide. Mark Coker is not only thoughtful and hard-working but not above accepting new ideas from others for something that is already a very fine product. All authors should read both this and his Marketing Guide, which itself took me down avenues I really would never have thought of. Thanks Mark, and congratulations on a job well done.<br/>

            I thought I could get around reading this book since I already had several titles published in print and on Kindle.  Boy was I wrong.  This book is so helpful.  I could read it easily and follow the directions, even with my three year old jumping on my back.  Of course, the best part of all was having my works accepted for the Smashwords Premium Catalog.  I even went back to Kindle and uploaded my new files there, using this guide to improve the look of my ebooks.  Thanks Mark.<br/>

            I feel a debt of gratitude to Mark Coker for creating such a detailed and easy to follow guide. A thorough read of it simplified the process no end. My only issue is with the cover, as I uploaded a pic that was too small even though the size matched the style guide's recommended 600 by 900 pixels, at least according to Microsoft's picture editor. I've now uploaded another but the small one is still showing by my listing. I have resubmitted (on Sunday) so perhaps this will right itself. If you are a first timer, as I was, I suggest you spend an hour or so reading the guide from the comfort of your sofa, and resist the urge to try to learn as you go. From reading it I also learned a lot about Microsoft word I never knew, which was a big bonus. So, thank you heaps, Mark.<br/>

            I have published over 20 books on smashwords.com, (my career goes back 35 years) and have found the experience tolerable, and especially due to this easy to follow style-guide and Mark Coker and staff’s continuing help. Smashwords Style Guide assumes the reader has little knowledge nor aptitude for the mundane details of formatting for the e-world so explains everything in simple grade one fashion; for someone like myself, it’s terrific. I could have easily given up on the effort and I’m glad I persevered, thanks.<br/>

            Excellent, straight-forward guide to organizing an ebook.  It's far too easy to forget the obvious things like how pagination settings would differ when reading on the screen rather than in a book.  <br />
<br />

            The guide helped me some but I still need to figure out how to indent paragraphs with a ruler! All the guide says is to do it, but not how. (at least I can't find it) Changing paragraph settings doesn't fix the problem:-(<br/>

            An excellent guide - provided you follow the instructions as closely as possible. By doing so, my ebook was uploaded without a hitch, translated into all available formats, and it made the premuim catalogue within a couple of days. My advice - sit down with a nice cuppa coffee, and adjust your manuscript step-by-step as per the instructions in this book. It will take a while, but the results are likely to be well worth it!<br/>

            Coker's book is essential. Even so, several of you have had some trouble formatting. Here is a link to a couple of templates I made for my own use, for fiction and nonfiction, perhaps they will give you a place to start.<br />

            Before publishing my first novel at Smashwords, I decided to take a look at this book.  I didn't think it could teach me much, but how wrong I was!  The Smashwords Style Guide saved me hours of frustration by showing me how to get my book right first time.  The tips and tricks for MS Word are particularly useful.  All in all, I can't recommend this book highly enough.<br/>

            I tend to agree with Michael Perry. I'm not an author, I'm a small,boutique publisher that is trying to break into the eBook world with books already, or soon to be, in print. Working backwards from printer formatted PDF files is a real chore. I'm now trying to get at the original Indesign files to learn how to format output from there into Word format according to Smashwords style guide. It sure would help if I could find pre-formated templates for either Indesign or Word that would make the eBook generation much less time consuming. Any ideas out there?<br/>

            George Paxton's February 27, 2010 comment is 'spot on.' The #1 problem with creating ebooks for Smashwords is that all the documentation, including that by Mark Coker, assumes that writers will be working The Microsoft Way, which is the ugly, time-consuming, inefficient, inflexible way that Microsoft Word is structured to encourage.<br />
<br />
As Paxton notes, proper writing for publication uses stylesheets (aka "named styles"). A first-level heading, for instanced, is attached to a style called Heading 1, a quote is given the style Quote and so on. Even word-level formatting like italics is done with text styles. Absolutely no in-place formatting is used in laying out the book. Font, font size, indention etc are all defined in the style definition. That makes attaching and changing the formatting easy. In a couple of seconds, every formatting trait for an entire book can be changed.<br />
<br />
Microsoft, in its infinite stupidity, makes doing that incredibly difficult, particularly in comparison to properly designed products such as InDesign. In Word, named styles are buried in the Format menu behind a series of convoluted buttons and additional windows that must have been created by a sadist intent on filling the life of everyone who uses Word with drudgery. The result is a style system so awful, few use it. Instead, they hand enter the formatting every time it changes. <br />
<br />
I know. I layout books for publishers. Virtually every time I get a Word document from an author, I find it cluttered with an infinite number of little author-made formatting tweaks that have to be stripped out to fit the publisher's style guide. It's virtually impossible to get them to think otherwise. They are slaves of The Microsoft Way.<br />
<br />
Smashwords needs to escape from The Microsoft Way. It needs to give us a book template with styles for every formatting feature users are likely to need and that their reformatting software can handle. We shouldn't be having to spend our time klutzing with Word's clumsy hand formatting and rules or fretting with what the result we look like. We should be concentrating on what we are saying not fretting over what our guesses at formatting will look like after it has been run through Smashword software.<br />
<br />
In short, give us Word templates with styles that do all the work of formatting and give good results at your output. Free us to focus on content not on formatting.<br />
<br />
Contact me if you'd like to discuss this in more detail.<br/>

            It certainly worked for me. After following the guide, I had only one minor "printed in" error called and I fixed it quick and the file sailed through after that. Smashwords e-books even look better (much better) inside than Amazon Kindle at the moment. Despite submitting a nicely formatted book to them, all I got back was block paragraphs with no indentation at all. Very hard to read.<br/>

            Smashwords is the ultimate site for getting new authors off of the ground. This Style Guide helps you do that by providing tips, guidelines and helpful information to make the process as smooth as possible. After reading this Style Guide, you will not likely ever need to resubmit a book because of faulty formatting. It's a MUST read for upcoming authors looking to publish on Smashwords.<br/>

            I first of all want to congratulate Mark Coker on developing an amazing web site - my whole experience with Smashwords has been exemplary - and it's all free of charge to convert a book to ebook formats that are collectively compatible with all e-readers on the market today! The site documentation is professionally done to say the least, the style guidelines in particular. I was a little intimidated at first because following all the details seemed like a daunting task; but taking the guidelines a little at at time made achieving excellent results quite easy. Within 2 days including the editing of my manuscript (144,000+ words plus 41 images), I was approved for inclusion in the Premium Catalog - I am thrilled with this result and have high hopes that the world-wide exposure and distribution will be a shot in the arm for selling my book and getting the word out.<br />
Just a word of caution though, you must take every word in the style guidelines seriously, Mark means what he says and doesn't mince many words - as a writer, I appreciate this very much - many thanks Mark on a masterful job!<br />

            Out of all the books I've ever read this book is the most important. Without Mark's help found in this book I wouldn't now have my first seven books published and ready for people to read. Mark made it easy to follow in order to get my work published. Sure, I messed up a few times, but that was my fault. Now that I know the proper way to follow Mark's work (Do what he says)it's super easy to get my latest book uploaded to Smashwords, along with the cover. Thanks, Mark.<br/>

            The style guide is clear and comprehensive. However it fails badly in one important area.<br />
Microsoft Word - and OpenOffice Writer - really start to sing and perform if you take the trouble to set up a style sheet / template, defining all the font and paragraph formats you intend using.<br />
Having just been through the PT of having to 'fix' documents written with templates - for conventional print publication - I would suggest that, with the book, is provided a basic book template so that, when starting to write an ebook, the correct formatting is already in place. This will not fix problems with the copyright page, but the basic formatting will be ready to go.<br/>

            The guide is a must read for anyone who wants to publish on Smashwords, even if you are a software engineer(which I am). It is well-written and does a good job of demystifying the arcane world of Word. However, I do think it needs a linkable index. My day job required me to read a lot of guides. Generally I would skim them to get a feeling of what information was available and where, then turn to the relevant section when I needed it. You can't do that with this guide. Most disappointing is that it is particularly hard to use on a Kindle because digital ink technology makes paging so slow.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see more information on images. Science Fiction/Fantasy books often require maps. After spending a week learning to use Illustrator in order to produce a good map, I was dismayed to find it doesn't show at all on my Kindle.<br/>

            Great little guide Mark. I did have a question that wasn't addressed in the guide. Since my bookcopy in Word was set for 5.5x8.5" pages, I left it that size for the upload. It didn't seem to matter, but I was wondering if you had a recommended page size?? Also, where I placed a blank line between paragraphs was ignored by the converter, so I uploaded again with a centered line with ~ ~ ~ in the line to get this separation for shifts of point of view within a chapter. Is there something I missed on how to actually get a blank line, say between paragraphs done as blocks without the first line indented?<br />

            Not only did did the Style Guide make it possible for me to publish an ebook, it gave more info in a few pages, about MS Word, than anything I've read from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Thank you for making this available for free.<br/>

            I am finding the “The Smashwords Style Guide” very useful.  In fact, I could not have published my Smashwords ebooks without it.<br />
<br />
Although I have been a ‘Word’ user for years, I learned some new things, such as the ‘show/hide’ feature.  I also like that the book shows the easiest way to do formatting tasks, including the direction to reduce the whole file to its simplest form as a ‘txt’ file to get rid of all the bad formatting that has crept into the document; and only then re-save it in ‘Word’ and add the little bit of necessary formatting.  <br />
<br />
In short, I like the idea and the implementation of Smashwords.  This book helps us authors with necessary information and it is a great addition to the overall helpfulness of your site.  Please accept my thanks.<br />

            I've only glanced at it so far, but it appears to be excellent. And not only for publishing works here. Anyone planning to publish on the Kindle, for instance, would do well to read it, for a strong understanding of the peculiarities of this new mode of publication.<br/>

            This guide is exactly as it is described, a guide to walk the writer through the formatting process. Even if you're a novice, or I should say especially if you're a novice, reading this ebook is all the more important. I've been writing for ten years and published for seven and there are several things listed in Mark Coker's formatting instructions that I wasn't aware of through Word. This ebook is highly detailed, yet delivered in such a way that even my youngest child would understand.<br />
<br />
For those who are working in Word 2007 or plan to purchase the upcoming Word 2010, be aware the formatting instructions are based on Word 2003. Regardless, each item in Mr. Coker's formatting instructions can still be found in Word 2007. Most of it will be in "Word Options" when you click on the Word icon button in the top left corner of your document. The others will be found in Page Layout under Custom Margins or in Review. I do recommend Word 2007 users save their m/s in the 97-2003 Compatibility Mode so the final document you upload is a .doc rather than a .docx. <br />
<br />
I read through the Style Guide slowly to make sure I formatted everything as recommended or required and was able to do it in only a few hours (I'm very picky and wanted to make sure my m/s was perfect). Needless to say, the uploaded document went through in the first try. Follow the guidelines and you shouldn't experience any problems at all. If you'll open your m/s as you read, you can change it as you go. This removes much of the stress when you see how many pages are in the Style Guide. Don't let that deter you. About a third of the ebook at the beginning is information already found on the website and you've probably already read it. <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to uploading many more books in the upcoming months and watching to see the new and different directions this company will take. It's very exciting to be your own boss and see your dreams realized. <br />

            Thank you for this guide- it has really helped me raise my game!<br />
<br />
Most of us use Word like we use our brains- at about 5% of their potential!<br />
<br />
I have learned more since downloading this guide about formatting than in all the years I have been using this software.<br />
<br />
Also, having been properly motivated, I managed to make a presentable cover for my book!<br />
<br />
Again- THANK YOU!<br />
<br />
And to all other writers- download it and READ IT! <br />
<br />
Here is the portal to the future :-)<br />

            After seeing the results of some books here that were not formatted using this guide, I am glad that I read this simple yet indispensible guide and use it for everything I have published so far.<br />
<br />
Underestimate the importance of this guide and it's instructions at your peril.  OK, maybe not peril, but do what it says, please!<br/>

            Fantastic guide! After dealing with a dozen or so eBook retailers, Smashwords is a breath of fresh air so far. I'm in the process of converting my work (11 titles at the moment), so it can appear here and this guide is absolutely essential.<br/>

            This style guide is an absolutely crucial read prior to publishing your ebook.  I was all fat, dumb and happy thinking I'd just hit "publish" and my beautifully formatted ebook with the fancy colors and fonts would be whisked away to stardom.<br />
<br />
After reading the style guide, I now get it.  Ebooks are a different animal.  I do want my book available to the largest number of readers so I'm going to follow the advice here.<br />
<br />
I also agree with Christopher.  The guide is not written for techies at all.  If you have even a passing knowledge of MS Word, you will find this guide helpful in walking you through the steps.<br />
<br />
An absolute must read.<br />

            If you are an independent author/writer, then there is no getting around reading this ebook(unless you are also a software engineer).<br />
<br />
What I loved about this book was that Mark doesn't take any reader for granted, anyone can understand his instructions.  Mark also happens to be a very patient guy and extremely helpful, all of which comes through very clearly in this easy to understand guide.<br/>
